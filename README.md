# Ocean Superfarms: Finding the Best Spots to Grow Seafood

## Description

Marine aquaculture is an increasingly important strategy for sustainably feeding growing human populations. Aquaculture, defined as the organized cultivation and production of aquatic organisms for commercial, recreational, or public use, supports food security, conservation, and economic development (Alleway et al., 2018). In California, aquaculture accounts for approximately 6% of the total value of the U.S. aquaculture industry and includes four main sectors: finfish, shellfish, algae, and natural resource agencies (Wright et al., 2025). Finfish and shellfish comprise over 70% of production value and are primarily produced for human consumption. Oysters and the critically endangered red abalone are two commercially significant species, with oysters dominating mollusk production in California. Oysters are typically restricted to sea surface temperatures (SST) of 11–30°C and depths of 0–70 meters (Oliver, 2025), while red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*) prefer cooler SSTs of 8–18°C and depths of 0-25 meters (SeaBase, n.d.). Identifying overlapping suitable habitats within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) may help guide sustainable aquaculture development.

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate the suitability of West Coast Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) for developing marine aquaculture for multiple oyster species and an additional selected species, red abalone. Suitable locations are determined based on species-specific ranges of sea surface temperature (SST) and depth. The assignment incorporates methods for working with both vector and raster data, including raster resampling and masking, as well as the application of map algebra techniques. The project consists of two components: (1) following a standardized workflow to create a final map of suitable oyster aquaculture areas in West Coast EEZs, and (2) developing a function that generates maps of suitability by EEZ based on user defined temperature ranges, depth limits, and species selection.
